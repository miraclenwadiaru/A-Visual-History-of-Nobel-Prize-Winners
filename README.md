# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners
Exploratory data analysis using Python

# Introduction.

This project is one of the Datacamp projects. It was done to test my knowledge of data manipulation and visualization. And also for the preparation of Associate Data Analyst certification. The dataset was pulled from Kaggle.

# Project Description

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well-known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. 

# Aim

To explore the patterns and trends of over 100 years worth of Nobel prize winners.

To answer questions like, what characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice?
 
# Insights
